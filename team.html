                <p style="font-size: 15px; opacity: 80%;"> Calisia Arts foundation was established on the initiative of
                    artists, educators and cultural animators associated with Kalisz. Its aim is to promote classical
                    music and expand the cultural offer of Kalisz and Greater Poland by organising artistic events of
                    national and international scope. The Calisia Arts foundation is based in Kalisz, the oldest Polish
                    city, which is known for the Calisia grand and upright piano factory. Kalisz is also famous for one
                    of the few schools in the world which educates grand and upright piano builders, renovators and
                    tuners, the Arnold Fibiger Piano Building School, so naturally the promotion of piano music is a key
                    aspect of the Foundation’s activities. </br></br> </p>

                            renovators and tuners, the Arnold Fibiger Piano Building School, so naturally the

                            of piano music is a key aspect of the Foundation’s activities.
