                        The Calisia Arts foundation was established on the initiative of artists, educators and
                        cultural animators associated with Kalisz. Its aim is to promote classical music and expand
                        the cultural offer of Kalisz and Greater Poland by organising artistic events of national and
                        international scope. The Calisia Arts foundation is based in Kalisz, the oldest Polish city,
                        which is known for the Calisia grand and upright piano factory.
                        Kalisz is also famous for one of the few schools in the world which educates grand and
                        upright piano builders, renovators and tuners, the Arnold Fibiger Piano Building School, so
                        naturally the promotion of piano music is a key aspect of the Foundation’s activities.
