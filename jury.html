                                Born in Empoli, she spontaneously approaches
                                keyboards and free composition from an early
                                age. She began studying the piano at the age of
                                6, demonstrating a very precocious talent. She
                                graduated in piano in 1987 with full marks and
                                honors at the Luigi Cherubini conservatory in
                                Florence, under the guidance of Maestro
                                Roberto Caglieri, performing the unabridged
                                repertory of studios by Chopin op.10 and op.25
                                and “Gaspard de la Nuit” di Ravel. She
                                perfected herself at the Imola Academy with
                                Franco Scala, Lazar Berman, Boris.
                                Petrusciansky, Jorg Demus, Paul Badura-Skoda
                                and later in Florence with M ° Clive Britton, a pupil of Claudio Arrau. Winner of
                                numerous
                                national and international piano competitions, she is also the winner of the national
                                competition for qualifications and exams in music conservatories held in 1990, thanks to
                                which, from 1995 to today, she has been a tenured
                                piano teacher in Italian conservatories, contributing to the training of dozens of
                                talents.
                                From 1995 to 2002 she is a piano teacher at the A. Scontrino Conservatory in Trapani.
                                From 2002 to today she has been a piano teacher at the Vincenzo Bellini conservatory in
                                Palermo. She has to her credit numerous concerts as a soloist (including one at the
                                “Sala
                                Bossi” in Bologna , one at the Concert Hall of the Conservatoire “ B. Marcello” in
                                Venice ),
                                solo piano concerts with orchestras (including the Stoccarda Philharmonic Orchestra) and
                                many concerts as a chamber musician or with important soloists, such as Calogero
                                Palermo and Fabrice Moretti. In 1987 she recorded the 12 studies op. 10 by F. Chopin in
                                the context of "live concerts" in Fiesole (Radio Montebeni). She has to her credit the
                                creation of CDs, including:
                                – a CD for KIWANIS INTERNATIONAL made with the "Cameristi dell'Accademia Musicale
                                DI Firenze" which includes, among other compositions, Arnold Schoemberg “Pierrot
                                Lunaire”;
                                - the CD "Recital" with Calogero Palermo;
                                - the CD "Colors Inside" with the violinist Maurizio Rocca - the latter CD includes some
                                world premiere performances of works by contemporary Sicilian composers such as Marco
                                Betta, Gaetano Randazzo, Giacomo Cuticchio, Gaetano Siino, Alberto Maniaci.
                                She also collaborated on the recording for Wide Records of a double CD of the complete
                                J.S. Bach concertos for two, three and four keybord. She has recently collaborated with
                                Ramin Bahrami, with whom she has created at the Bellini Conservatory of Palermo the
                                concert BWV 1060 by J.S. Bach as part of the "Migrant Literature Festival”, organized by
                                the City of Palermo, in collaboration with the Massimo Theater. Her participation as a
                                soloist in the "Piano City Palermo 2017" event is also recent, in which she performed a
                                fullbodied extract of J.S. Bach's Well Tempered Clavier.
