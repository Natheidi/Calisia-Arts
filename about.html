                    Kalisia, as one of the places on the amber route, was mentioned for the first time in the work of
                    the
                    Alexandrian scholar Ptolemy around the
                    2nd century A.D. According to the scholars, Kalisia of Ptolemy can be identified with today’s
                    Kalisz.
                    This record made Kalisz be proud of the oldest written certificate from among Polish cities.

                    The favourable location at the crossroads of the trade routes from the north to the south and from
                    the west to the east of the continent favoured the development of Kalisz and it openness to

                    The Nazi occupation was a period of oppression and discrimination for Kalisz people. Post-war years

                    Kalisz diocese was established.
                    Modern Kalisz covers an area of 70 km2, with app. 110 thousand residents. Between 1975 and 1998 it
                    was a
                    capital city of Kalisz Voivodeship. In a new administrative division the city is located in
